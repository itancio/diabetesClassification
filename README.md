# Diabetes Binary Classification

Objective: classify a diabetes diagnosis based on patients' data. We want to gain insights on different factors - such as demographics, lifestyle, medical history, medical measurements, medication, symtoms - that are associated to diabetes. Then select features that have strong correlation with the diagnosis and use it to train a classification model.

## II. Describe and display the datasets
